## Project Overview

A web application that generates personalized bedtime stories for children using AI-powered text generation and image creation. The app creates unique, age-appropriate stories based on user inputs and generates accompanying illustrations to create an engaging, interactive reading experience.

## Core Concept

Parents and caregivers can create custom bedtime stories tailored specifically to their child's interests, age, and preferences. The application combines OpenRouter's language models for story generation with Replicate's image generation capabilities to produce complete, illustrated stories that feel personal and magical for each child.
